"Empirical Analysis" contains all the codes for table generation as well as all the generated tables. 
For table 4, should run tbl4A.R to tbl4D.R first to get part of the table 4 results, then run tbl4.R to generate the whole table.
Except for table4.csv which is generated by R, all other tables are generated by Stata thus with .doc or .rtf format.
Table 8 is derived independently without the original paper to indicate whether the information assimilation speed indicated by number of readings and comments could influence the return.

To see all results in pdf format, please turn to "Result in pdf" fold.
