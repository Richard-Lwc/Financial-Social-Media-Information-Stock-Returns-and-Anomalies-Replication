"data extract & clean" contains all the data needed as well its prepocessing code which are compiled in each fold with the data's name. Typically, in every fold there would be a .csv as well as a .dta file  of the data generated by Stata do file, for the sake of both using the data in R as well as Stata in the Empirical Analysis fold.
For example, for the fold "ME", there is a "ME.csv" and "ME.dta" generated by "Market Value.do".
